// API: application programming interface

// it is a medium by which communications happens between different servers and database.

// eg- multiplayer game different player from different devices puts https req to the which communicates to api and then api updates things in dbs and then sends req to different players.


//Rest Api

//Rest api are those api which follows these set of rules

// 1)res should be same irrespective of the platform (whether it is mac user or windows or linux user ).

// 2)route should be on the bases of noun eg user/place/id not on the verb updateuser,deleteuser,createuser(these are wrong).

//3)HTTPS methods should be  used for doing operations on the routes put,get,post,delete

//4)stateless -> the res of current req should be irrespective of previous req.
